## Comparison: Azure App Service vs Virtual Machines (VM)

| **Criteria**     | **Azure App Service**                                        | **Azure Virtual Machines (VM)**                             |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Costs**        | Cost-effective for small to medium apps, with pricing tiers based on resource consumption. Managed services reduce management overhead. | More expensive due to the need to manage infrastructure, scaling, patching, and backups. Users pay for the full VM capacity, regardless of usage. |
| **Scalability**  | Built-in auto-scaling with minimal setup, allowing easy adjustments to handle traffic spikes. Pricing adjusts based on the actual load. | Manual or semi-automated scaling that requires infrastructure management and monitoring. Complex scaling setup may lead to higher costs and delays. |
| **Availability** | Offers high availability with built-in redundancy and failover. Microsoft manages updates, security, and uptime guarantees. | Requires manual setup for high availability and redundancy. More complex to configure for automatic failover and disaster recovery. |
| **Workflow**     | Integrated with CI/CD pipelines, simplifying deployment, and updates. Easy management of versions and rollbacks without touching infrastructure. | Requires setting up CI/CD and managing deployment scripts. More manual effort is needed to handle version control, deployment, and rollbacks. |

## Justification for Choosing App Service:
Azure App Service is the more appropriate solution for this scenario because it provides **cost-effective** resource management, **simplified auto-scaling**, and **high availability** with minimal operational overhead. Its integration with CI/CD pipelines and built-in automation make it ideal for quickly deploying and managing applications. For smaller to medium-sized applications, App Service reduces infrastructure management burdens, leading to faster development cycles and lower operational costs, making it the best choice over Virtual Machines.
